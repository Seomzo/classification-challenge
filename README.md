### Description:
I worked at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and was tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. I was provided with a dataset containing information about emails, classified as either spam or not spam. My goal was to develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model to accurately detect spam emails and filter them out of the customersâ€™ inboxes.

To achieve this, I created two classification models using the provided data and evaluated which model performed better at detecting spam. The two models I developed were a logistic regression model and a random forest model. After evaluation, the random forest classifier achieved an accuracy score of 94.4%, while the logistic regression model scored 93.1%. This highlighted the random forest classifier as the more effective model for detecting spam emails.
